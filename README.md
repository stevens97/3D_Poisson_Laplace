![alt text](https://github.com/stevens97/3D_Poisson_Laplace/blob/main/Capacitor_Field.png)

What this program does:
========================================

This Python script is based on an old Computational Physics project, in which Poisson's and Laplace's equations are solved for:
- A single point charge.
- A line charge.
- A parallel capacitor.

The electric fields of the aforementioned are then visualised.
